Because my mother spoke to me in Spanish when I was young there are some phrases and words in Spanish that I know instinctively without having to translate in my head, there are even some words that I learned in Spanish first and did not learn the English counterpart for until much later in life, which is why I sometimes would forget the English word for something even though I could not hold a conversation in Spanish. It has been really interesting to learn Spanish with this background, because there are a few grammar rules in Spanish that I know because they just ""sound right"" to me from listening to my family speak and then in class I get to learn why those specific grammar rules exist and how they work.",3
