Hi, NAME,

Thank you for showing interest in our study.

We are looking for participants who only speak English as their first language and also are actively using or learning Spanish as their second language without knowledge of any other third language.

Thereâ€™s no foreseen harm during the experiment, and the experiment will last less than 30 minutes. We plan to conduct the experiment in person at Rutgers College Ave Campus. 

If you are interested still, please reply to this email so we can start a short screening process online (a short questionnaire). 

Feel free to reply to this email if you have any other worries or questions. 

Best,
Jiawei Shao
